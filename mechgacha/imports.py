It still retains the sensor-heavy head/upper torso (though now with a helmet) and general equipment, just with thrusters replaced with like added hardpoints, protection and ground mobility (threads, crampons, hovercraft, etc) 					ah, uh... it's a special personal unit of a famous ace/freedom fighter that's like fighting for the betterment of humanity, it's based from a standard military/industrial unit, but was heavily modified and customized to fit a more exploration, reconaissance, sharpshooting role"))
