Must be shut down in combat and environmentally hazardous situations.	Needlepoint contacts- auto-balancing limbs designed to minimize environmental damage	Augmenting Manipulators- a set of nimble, thin arms with a variety of ways to grasp and manipulate objects, ranging from the size of a cat to a small tree	Gyroscopic Pod- a fairly stable structure built to contain pilot, sensitive instruments, and any samples as securely as possible within a larger structure.	Stargazer’s Instruments- a variety of measurement devices to assist in your endeavors	Solar Fins- large, retractable solar panels used as supplementary power support	Mistcutter- a sample cutting tool able to use water or grit, depending on environmental availability.	TEETH.	Surveyor’s Adaptation- by sacrificing limb mobility (or consolidating them), the mech now can withstand over 16,000 PSI at the weakest point. (not tested against damage from artillery, temperatures over 900C, or twisting force.)	the Fishbowl- a mostly spherical core built of transparent, UV-protective material. May be rendered one-way. 	Paddleboards - flexible fins originally made for movement in shallow waters. Can also be used for land maneuvers, to some effect.	Noodlers- limbs made specifically for catching large, predatory fish.	Bare Joints- through the power of easily-replaced and cleaned parts, the joints on limbs are now bare!	Fogflare- a heavily modified and overclocked cutting tool able to use water or grit, depending on environmental availability. Dubiously legal."))
